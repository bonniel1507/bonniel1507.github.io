            <h1 class="margin text-center">Password Saver</h1>
            <p>The project allows people to save their usernames and passwords.</p>
            <p>This project was created using Firebase and Firebase is a data storing platform. The whole project was created with Javascript.</p>
            <p>In the biggining, me and my partner was struggling becasue we don't understand. Thank god we found very useful videos on Youtube thats about Firebase 9. It's also difficult for us because we can only message each other through text messages and having other things that doesn't allow us to work on it the same time. She works on it at the morning while I was asleep, when I woke up she has work. And until she can work on it at night, it's the end of the day for me. So, other than test messages, we created a Google Doc and put our process in there and explain the purpose of the code we individually added.
                <br>
                We had an expo in the cafeteria and we present our websites to vistors and some classes that came with their teacheres. We watch the judges getting closer. They got to our nomber and I was the one presenting, there was a little trip while presenting, but it went well at the end. When they were done, I went to the other side and saw some of the seniors' project, it was nice and I saw some of my classmates too. We also have an inclass presentation to do. Ws made a Google Slide to explain our process to the class. I feel like we were so under prepare for the slides. I was also glad that I have a partner because for one slide I didn't explain well enough, but she comes in and explain it for me.</p>
